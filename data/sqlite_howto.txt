Run sqlite.exe for the sqlite prompt, or type sqlite3 in a dos prompt window
open table with open words.db

The database "words" has been created with:
sqlite> sqlite3 words

The table words was created with:
sqlite> create table words (id int(6) primary key, word varchar(7), phrase varchar(100), length int);
will have 3 tables: word_4, word_5, word_6  -  length column will be changed to set column

To create a new table:
commands:
sqlite> create table <table_name>(<column1_name> <type>(<size>), <column2_name> <type>, ...etc);

Insert data:
sqlite> insert into <table_name> values('column1_value', 'column2_value');

retrieve data:
sqlite> select * from <table_name>;

Current data: 
1|gear|equipment|4
2|rear|behind|4
3|real|exists|4
4|reel|device for winding line|4
5|feel|sensation|4
6|fell|knock down|4
7|fill|occupy|4

From the sqlite documentation: CSV Import

Use the ".import" command to import CSV (comma separated value) data into an SQLite table. The ".import" command takes two arguments which are the name of the disk file from which CSV data is to be read and the name of the SQLite table into which the CSV data is to be inserted.

Note that it is important to set the "mode" to "csv" before running the ".import" command. This is necessary to prevent the command-line shell from trying to interpret the input file text as some other format.

sqlite> .mode csv
sqlite> .import C:/work/somedata.csv tab1
There are two cases to consider: (1) Table "tab1" does not previously exist and (2) table "tab1" does already exist.

In the first case, when the table does not previously exist, the table is automatically created and the content of the first row of the input CSV file is used to determine the name of all the columns in the table. In other words, if the table does not previously exist, the first row of the CSV file is interpreted to be column names and the actual data starts on the second row of the CSV file.

For the second case, when the table already exists, every row of the CSV file, including the first row, is assumed to be actual content. If the CSV file contains an initial row of column labels, that row will be read as data and inserted into the table. To avoid this, make sure that table does not previously exist.
